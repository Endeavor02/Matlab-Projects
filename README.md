# About Me (short bio)

My name is Jeffrey Blanda and I'm a Junior Computer Engineering student at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, NJ. As the son of a C# developer and ex-IBM employee turned small buisness owner, I've grown up around technology and it's become a major influence on my life. I attended Cape Cod Tech for their Information Technology program and earned multiple industry certifications including the CompTIA A+ while also teaching myself PHP and SQL. While attending Cape Cod Tech I was offered a co-op job in IT. After working for a month I realized that Information Technology wasn't challenging enough for me so I applied to colleges and universities for Electrical/Computer engineering. I ended up choosing TCNJ for its small size and high academic standing. I focus my efforts on the digital aspects of my hardware courses and how it relates to my development experience.

I am currently in persuit of more ways to challenge and prove myself, if you appreciate my repositiories and are in a position to offer internship information, feel free to reach out to me.
